<h2>How to create a custom CSV?</h2>

<p>
    All the rom and CSV file processing check for only one column: "name", which is the game zip
    file name, without the extension (example: "altbeast").
</p>

<p>
    That's it. All other columns are ignored, and are for your usage only, to filter using Excel
    or a similar tool. You can do whatever you want, as long as the file is a valid CSV (all
    lines have the same columns number, the column separator must be consistent, etc).
</p>

<p>
    The "name" column doesn't have to be the first column and can be anywhere, as long as it has
    the column header.
</p>

<p>
    Here are a few ways to create a custom CSV:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="pages/csv/convert-dat.html" class="navmenu">Convert a DAT file to a CSV file</a></li>
    <li>Use a site like <a href="http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/lista_mame.php?lang=en" class="blank">ArcadeItalia</a>
        and export the search results as CSV</li>
    <li>Write a text file by hand, put one game name per line. Just don't forget to add "name;"
        on top for the CSV header.</li>
    <li>Write a shell/batch/Powershell script to export the list of rom files in a folder to a
        text file, remove the ".zip", and add the "name;" CSV header.</li>
</ul>
